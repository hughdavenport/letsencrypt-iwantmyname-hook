# letsencrypt.sh DNS hook for the [iwantmyname](https://iwantmyname.com/) DNS registrar

This repository contains a ruby-based hook for the [`letsencrypt.sh`](letsencrypt.sh: https://github.com/lukas2511/letsencrypt.sh) project (a [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/), shell script ACME client) that allows a user to obtain a certificate from the `Let's Encrypt`_ API via a DNS challenge. The hook will login to your iwantmyname account with provided credentials, and either add, modify, or remove DNS records, and poll until this change has propogated before allowing Let's Encrypt to confirm that changes.
